# PizzaPy
PizzaPy is a web application created with Python and Flask that was designed to allow a restaurant owner to manage available pizza toppings and create new pizzas.
I chose to build my app with Python because I believe Python is quite versatile and the syntax is easy to follow.

## Features
- Manage Toppings: Add, delete, and update pizza toppings.
- Manage Pizzas: Create, delete, and update pizzas with toppings.
- User Interface: Simple and intuitive web interface for interacting with the app.
